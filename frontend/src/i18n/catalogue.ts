/**
 * The message catalogue (Epic 25).
 *
 * **Both languages live side by side, in one entry.** A message is
 * `{ en: "Habits", fr: "Habitudes" }`, not two parallel files keyed the same way. Two
 * files drift: a key added to one and forgotten in the other is the ordinary failure of
 * every hand-rolled i18n layer, and it shows up as an English word in the middle of a
 * French sentence weeks later. Here the type below makes a missing French string a
 * compile error, and a reviewer reads the pair together instead of scrolling between
 * files.
 *
 * **Hand-rolled rather than react-i18next.** This app has three runtime dependencies —
 * react, react-dom, react-router — and pins its own money and date formatting on purpose
 * (see `money.ts`). Two languages that share a plural rule shape need a lookup, an
 * interpolation and a plural switch; that is the file you are reading, and it is smaller
 * than i18next's configuration would be.
 *
 * Keys are `area.thing`, and the area matches the page or module the string belongs to.
 * They are split across `messages/` by area so an epic touches one file.
