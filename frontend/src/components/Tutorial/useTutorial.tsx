/**
 * The guided tour on first sign-in (Epic 30).
 *
 * Five steps and a closing screen, walking a new account from "record an entry" to "read
 * the dashboard" in about two minutes. The shape worth explaining is that it is **not one
 * modal**. The welcome and the closing screen dim the page, because there is nothing to do
 * behind them. The four steps between do not: each one takes the person to a real page and
 * asks them to use the real control — record an entry, set a budget — so a backdrop that
 * blocked clicks would block the very thing the step is for. Those steps are a small panel
 * in a corner, with the control they point at ringed (see `data-tour` in styles.css).
 *
 * **Whether it opens is decided by the account, not the browser.** `tutorial_completed`
 * and `tutorial_skipped_at` are columns (migration 0022), so a phone and a laptop agree,
 * and a cleared browser does not welcome the same person a second time. Older servers
 * send neither field; "absent" is read as "seen" rather than as "new", so a client ahead
 * of its server never welcomes an account that has been recording entries for a year.
 *
 * **No focus trap.** Escape leaves, Tab moves on, and a step that asks for typing in a
 * form must not pull focus back to its own buttons. The two dimmed screens focus their
 * primary button once, so Enter and Escape work without a click; the panel steps leave
 * focus where the page put it — the amount field, on the entry step.
