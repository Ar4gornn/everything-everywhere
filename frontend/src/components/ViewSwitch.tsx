/**
 * Two views of one section, switched by a control at the top of the page.
 *
 * A section is one bottom tab; a view is a route under it. The Dashboard has the summary
 * and the calendar — "what happened, and what is due", in totals or day by day. The Habits
 * tab has the habits and the books (Epic 28) — both records of what a person is doing with
 * their own time, neither money. Each view is a real route so it can be linked and shared;
 * the tab stays lit for both (`also` in App.tsx). See App.tsx for the whole navigation
 * argument, including why neither view gets a tab of its own.
