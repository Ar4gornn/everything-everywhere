 * queued, and changes queued together are merged — they replace whole subtrees, so the
 * merge is exactly what sending them in turn would have done — and sent as one.

 * **What is shown** is always the last state the server confirmed with the in-flight and
 * queued patches laid over it. A request that fails drops its own patch and nothing else:
 * the screen falls back to the confirmed state plus whatever is still queued, and the
