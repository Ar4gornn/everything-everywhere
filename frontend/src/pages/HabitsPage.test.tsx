 * Habits (Epics 23 and 26, stories 23.3 and 26.3).
 *
 * The behaviour worth protecting here is that the page never computes a verdict of its own:
 * "done", "met", the week rollup and the streak all come from the server, so the screen and
 * the daily digest cannot disagree (AD-30). A test that asserted a locally derived streak
 * would be asserting a second implementation.
 *
 * What Epic 26 adds to that list: a check-in is an occurrence with a time, so the page has
 * to show the times and delete one *by id*; and a day the schedule does not ask for has to
 * say so rather than render a zero.
