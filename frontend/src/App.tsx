/**
 * The navigation answer, in full, because it is the constraint two new features collided
 * with rather than a styling preference.
 *
 * The bottom bar holds **five** items at 375px — measured, not guessed — and Grow was
 * already displaced to the top bar to make room for Gym (Epic 19). A calendar and a habits
 * tab would make seven. Both were resolved explicitly:
 *
 * 1. **Habits takes a bottom tab, and Plan moves to the top bar.** The bottom bar is for
 *    what is opened at the moment it is needed. A check-in is a several-times-a-day thumb
 *    action — the highest-frequency tap in the app for anyone who keeps habits — while a
 *    budget is a *standing* monthly amount (AD-11) and a recurring template is edited
 *    perhaps twice a year. Ranking the sections by how often they are opened puts Plan
 *    eighth and Habits third, so Plan is the one that goes up top beside Grow.
 * 2. **The calendar takes no tab at all: it is the Dashboard's second view.** The dashboard
 *    already answers "what happened, and what is due" — in totals. The calendar answers the
 *    same question day by day. They are two views of one section, switched by a control at
 *    the top of the page, and `/calendar` is a real route so it can be linked and shared.
 *    What that costs: the calendar is one tap deeper than a tab would be.
 *
 * 3. **Recipes joins the top bar, and the app's name leaves it on a phone (Epic 27).**
 *    Ranked the same way: a recipe is consulted while cooking and a food is typed once, so
 *    the book sits well below the five thumb tabs. The frequent act in this module is "I
 *    ate this", and that is not a page — it is one control on the recipe and a layer on the
 *    calendar. But a third link did not fit for free. Measured at 375px, the phone bar's
 *    content box is 335px, and in French the three links are 193px ("Budget · Épargne ·
 *    Recettes") against English's 154px — so brand + links + a 44px settings target came to
 *    363 and wrapped to two rows on every French phone, which is the thing item 1's note
 *    refuses. The name is the item a phone needs least: the bottom tab says which section
 *    you are in, the page says what it is, and the installed app's name is on the home
 *    screen. It is now visually hidden at that width — out of flow, still in the
 *    accessibility tree — which leaves French at 245 of 335 and English at 206.
 *
 * 4. **Books is the Habits tab's second view (Epic 28), the way the calendar is the
 *    Dashboard's.** Ranked the same way, a shelf sits far below the five thumb tabs: a book
 *    is added once and touched again a handful of times over weeks. It is not money, so
 *    it does not belong under Entries; it is not consulted while cooking, so not beside
 *    Recipes. What it shares with Habits is the question — what am I doing with my own
 *    time — and both are records a person keeps for themselves rather than a household
 *    ledger. A fourth top-bar link was measured first: French would have put
 *    "Budget · Épargne · Recettes · Livres" at roughly 300 of the 335px content box, which
 *    fits at 375 and does not at 320. A view costs one tap and no width at all. A previous
 *    attempt at this epic added a sixth bottom tab; it was reverted for the reason the
 *    next paragraph gives.
 *
 * Rejected: a sixth tab (does not fit — the labels wrap and the targets fall under 44px);
 * a "More" overflow tab (spends a slot to hide two sections and demotes Gym, which Epic 19
 * deliberately promoted); merging Habits into Gym (one page with two unrelated jobs, and it
 * contradicts the interview that scoped Gym). For Epic 27, also rejected: displacing Stock
 * from the bottom bar — eating is more frequent than checking the pantry, so the ranking
 * argues for it, but Stock is wired to the shopping list Epic 14 built around a thumb tap
 * in a shop; and hanging /recipes off Entries as a second view the way /calendar hangs off
 * Dashboard — an entry is money and a recipe is not, so the two would share a tab and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * Verified at 375px in a browser rather than asserted — and at 320px, and in both
 * languages, because French is the longer one and is where this broke.
 */

/**
 * Every section, by id (Epic 33). Which slot each sits in, and in what order, is the
 * account's per layout (AD-49); the defaults are the arrangement argued above — five
 * thumb-reachable tabs, Plan, Grow and Recipes in the top bar.
 *
 * `label` is a message key rather than a word: the bar is drawn on every page, so a word
 * baked in here would be the one English string a French reader could never get away from.
