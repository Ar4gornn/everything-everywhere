"""Login rate limiting and lockout (Story 7.2, AD-26).

Deliberately in-process and in-memory. That has a real consequence, stated here rather than
discovered later: **the counters reset when the API restarts, and each replica keeps its
own.** For a single-container family instance that is honest and sufficient. Anything more —
Redis, a database table — is a dependency this deployment does not otherwise need, and a
database-backed limiter would also hand an attacker a cheap write amplification.

Two keys are counted independently, because either alone is evadable:

* per email, so one account cannot be ground down;
* per source address, so an attacker cannot spread a spray across many emails.
