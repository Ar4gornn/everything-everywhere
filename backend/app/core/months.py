"""AD-10: a ``YYYY-MM`` parameter becomes a half-open date range.

Half-open, always: ``>= start AND < end``. ``BETWEEN`` is the off-by-one that either drops
the last day or double-counts the boundary, and it is the kind of bug that only shows up as
a slightly wrong total.

**The month need not be the calendar one.** An account whose salary lands on the 26th keeps
a budget month that runs from the 26th to the 25th, and the period is labelled by the month
its **last day** falls in — so with a start day of 26, "2026-09" means 26 August to 25
September. A start day of 1 is the calendar month, unchanged, which is what every existing
account has.

The start day is limited to 1–28 by a database CHECK, and that is a real constraint rather
than a shrug: the 29th, 30th and 31st do not exist in every month, so a boundary on one of
them would have to be clamped — and a clamped boundary breaks the arithmetic that maps a
date back to its period, silently, in February. Paying on "the 31st" means the last banking
day of the month, which is a different feature (a rule, not a day) and not this one.
