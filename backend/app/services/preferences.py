"""The account's layout preferences (Epic 33, AD-49).

One ``jsonb`` column on ``users``, **sparse**: a key that is not stored means "the
default". So a card or a section added by a later epic appears for everyone without a data
migration, and the one function that fills the gaps is :func:`resolve`.

What is stored is what the client sent, validated here; what is returned is always
resolved, so the client never has to guess a default. Shape checks (types, lengths, the
two slot names) are the request schema's; everything that needs to know the catalogue
below — unknown ids, duplicates, completeness, the phone's caps — is here, with a code.
