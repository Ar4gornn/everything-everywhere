"""Dashboard aggregation.

AD-9: every figure here is a SQL aggregate. Nothing is summed row by row in Python, so
there is one definition of "August's expenses" rather than one per endpoint.

AD-22: every aggregate is wrapped so no rows yields 0, never NULL; and budget-versus-actual
is joined **from** the categories side, so a budgeted category with no spending appears at
zero instead of vanishing.

AD-1: every query below also carries an explicit ``user_id`` filter. Row-level security is
the authority and already scopes the session, so these are redundant — deliberately. They
are the same defence in depth the rest of the services keep, and this is the module where a
policy regression would leak totals rather than rows.
