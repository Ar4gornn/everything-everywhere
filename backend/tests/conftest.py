"""Test bootstrap.

Tests run against **real Postgres** on a throwaway database created and dropped per run.
There is deliberately no SQLite path: SQLite has no row-level security, so every assertion
in ``test_isolation.py`` would pass against it while proving nothing (AD-24).

The database URLs are rewritten *before* the application is imported, so the app's engine
is built against the test database.
