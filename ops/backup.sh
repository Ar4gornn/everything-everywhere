# Take a backup of the Everything Everywhere database (Story 7.4).
#
#   ./ops/backup.sh [destination-directory]
#
# Safe to run on a schedule. Writes one timestamped file per run and prunes anything older
# than RETENTION_DAYS.
#
# A backup on the same disk as the database is not a backup. It survives a mistake — a bad
# migration, a wrong DELETE — and it does not survive the disk dying or the machine being
# lost. Copy the output somewhere else. The README says so too, because it is the step
# people skip.
#
# --format=custom is compressed and lets pg_restore be selective. It is not a .sql file and
# cannot be piped into psql; use ops/restore.sh.
#
# Runs as the POSTGRES SUPERUSER, and that is not laziness. Every table has FORCE ROW LEVEL
# SECURITY, so policies apply even to the schema owner. pg_dump sets row_security=off,
# which per the Postgres manual does not bypass RLS — it raises an error if a policy would
# filter the output, exactly so a backup cannot come out silently incomplete. Dumping as
# the owner therefore fails outright:
#
#   ERROR: query would be affected by row-level security policy for table "budgets"
#
# The tempting fix is --enable-row-security. Do not. That dumps only the rows visible under
# current policies, so the day a policy is tightened the backups quietly start missing data
# and nothing complains. A superuser bypasses RLS by definition, so the dump is complete by
# construction.
